					<h2>SirixDB is an evolutionary, <strong>temporal</strong> NoSQL storage system at its heart, which efficiently stores the history of your data.
					<br />
					It uses <strong>copy-on-write</strong> (CoW) snapshots as well as data page versioning to store per revision and page changes.</h2>
					<p>SirixDB is especially well suited for flash drives as for instance SSDs due to its log-structure.
					<br />
					It allows <strong>time-travel</strong> queries in its binary <strong>XML</strong> as well as <strong>JSON</strong> based encodings.
                                        <br />

					<p>The following XQuery for JSON query opens a database and therein a resource in a specific revision based

									<h2>Keep the full history of your data for time travel analysis, audits, to correct human or application errors...</h2>
								</header>
								<p>SirixDB takes care of keeping storage space to a minimum while supporting the reconstruction of any revision in linear time.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, it allows time travel queries such that you're able to analyze the history of your data efficiently to predict the future or for audits.</p>

										<h3>Versioning</h3>
									</header>
									<p>SirixDB versions data as well as index-structures on a per revision and record level. As such versioning takes place at a fine-granular level. Furthermore, through a novel versioning algorithm called <em>sliding snapshot</em>, it can avoid write and read peaks.</p>

										<h3>REST</h3>
									</header>
									<p>SirixDB provides an asynchronous, RESTful API, which is non-blocking. It is built with <a href="https://vertx.io">Vert.x</a>, <a href="https://kotlinlang.org">Kotlin</a> (coroutines) and <a href="https://www.keycloak.org">Keycloak</a>.</p>

										<h3>XQuery / JSONiq</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Several extensions to an XQuery-processor called <a href="http://brackit.org">Brackit</a> are available. SirixDB, for instance, supports navigation via additional temporal XPath axes or XQuery functions for JSON data to navigate not only in space but also in time. Furthermore, SirixDB offers several additional precompiled functions to simplify the analysis of your temporal data. The API also provides a very convenient way to interact with SirixDB. Think of it as an in-memory representation of a DOM.</p>

										<h3>Transactional cursor API</h3>
									</header>
									<p>SirixDB provides a transactional low level, cursor-based API which is very powerful. SirixDB not only provides standard XPath axes. It also provides additionally temporal enhancements to navigate in time. Furthermore several other axes, for instance, a LevelOrder axis, a PostorderAxis and a DescendantAxis which can skip whole subtrees exists. Additionally, SirixDB provides several filters, a NestedAxis, a PredicateAxis and much more.</p>

									<header>
										<h3>Diffing-API</h3>
									</header>
									<p>SirixDB provides a way to currently import several revisions of an XML document with the help of a diffing-algorithm called Fast Matching Simple EditScript. With the help of this diffing-algorithm SirixDB is able to store the encountered differences in the tree structures instead of storing the whole revision.</p>
<p>Once you've stored several revisions in SirixDB, either through the import based on the diffing-algorithm or simply through working with SirixDB in the first place you're able to quickly compute diffs between any two revisions. SirixDB makes use of its stable node identifiers and optionally stored hashes. Each time the hashes of two nodes are equal, the whole subtrees in both revisions can be skipped while traversing both tree structures.</p>
